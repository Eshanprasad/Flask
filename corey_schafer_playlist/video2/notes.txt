1. We can have two or more route decorators for a single function.
for example:
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
def welcome(name):
    return "Hello, Welcome"

consider the above example. This welcome function will be executed and displays "Hello, Welcome" in default page ("/") as well as in home page("/home")


2. As we have same code in about.html and home.html
code:
    {% if title %}
    <title> Flask Blog - {{title}} </title>
    {% else %}
    <title>Flask Blog</title>
    {% endif %}
it's not a good practice to have code redundancy. If we have to change something, we have to go to these
two files and we have to change it. To avoid that we can use "template inheretance"

* To achieve template inheretance, we nned to have a parent template(html page), 
from there these two child pages home.html and about.html have to inherit and override.
